General Description:
This is the Go implementation of the Maxmind GeoIP API. It is incomplete and
work in progress the initial goal is support only two of the database types -
the City Lite and Country Lite. The only supported method is loading the full db
on startup into memory (memory cache).

Supported Access Methods:
- In Memory (Load(string))

Supported Database Formats:
- Country Edition    (dbType=1)
- City Edition REV 0 (dbType=6)
- City Edition REV 1 (dbType=2)

Supported Lookups:
- By IP Address (GetLocationByIP(string))
- By IP Number  (GetLocationByIPNum(uint32))

Supported Responses:
- Location
	* CountryCode string (available in all databases)
	* CountryName string (available in all databases)
	* City string
	* Region string
	* PostalCode string
	* Latitude float32
	* Longitude float32

To Do:
- Implement better error handling (report the error on load and lookups)
- Better returns, country edition has only code and name (perhaps use interfaces)
- Add better makefile for building and installation
- Add test cases and benchmarking
- Add support for more database formats

Build:
make (See Makefile for more details)

Example:
./example DBFILE IPADDRESS (i.e. ./example GeoIP.dat 1.1.1.1)

Usage:
Please see example.go for a complete example of how to use this library.
